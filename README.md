# The Dexios Robotic Hand - Lower-Level Control System

Welcome to the Dexios Robotic Hand project! The lower-level control system of the Dexios robotic hand includes several essential components working together to manage the movement mechanisms of the hand.

This repository houses the code used by the Arduino Mega to operate the serial communication interface, PID motor controllers and solenoid controllers.
